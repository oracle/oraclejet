   * @ojshortdesc Provides routing functionality with the state of the application being stored in the browser URL
   * @classdesc The router manages application navigation by tracking
   * state through the browser URL. The router's core responsibility is to publish
   * state changes due to navigation so that listeners can react and perform their
   * own logic, such as loading modules.
   * <p>
   * The root router instance is the top-most router, and it has no parent. This
   * instance may be created only once per application, and attempting to create
   * more than one root instance will result in an error.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * <h5>Create a CoreRouter with a named route and a redirect rule pointing to that route.</h5>
   * The route with the redirect has a blank path value, making it the default
   * route. However, since it redirects to <code>path1</code>, that is the effective
   * default route.
   * <pre class="prettyprint">
   * <code>
   * var root = new CoreRouter([
   *   { path: 'path1' },
   *   { path: '', redirect: 'path1' }
   * ]);
   * </code>
   * </pre>
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * <h5>With RegExp as path.</h5>
   * Note that all paths matching the regular expression will be using this configuration entry.
   * <pre class="prettyprint">
   * <code>
   * var root = new CoreRouter([
   *   { path: /path-?/ },
   *   { path: '', redirect: 'path-1' }
   * ])
   * </code>
   * </pre>
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * <h5>With multiple path matches in descending order.</h5>
   * When using RegExp paths, the order of the routes
   * defined is significant. When searching for a matching state, the router will
   * always search top-down to find the first matching state.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * In the example below, the value "path-1" will match the first route and will
   * be the one used, even though it would've also matched the second route.

   * Some routing use cases want to use the Observables of the router without
   * manipulating the browser history, such as navigating through a wizard whose
   * individual steps shouldn't be bookmarked. Here a child router is created and
   * configured to not manipulate history.
   * <pre class="prettyprint">
   * <code>
   * var child = root.createChildRouter(

   *   ],
   *   {
   *     history: 'skip'

   *   { path: 'orders/{id}/{mode}' }

   * If the required parameters aren't all passed, the behavior of the router will
   * be unpredictable.
   * </p>

   * <p>
   * <h5>Navigate to a page</h5>
   * Navigate to a page simply by supplying the path matching the route as an array
   * of strings. This method, like {@link CoreRouter#sync} returns a Promise<boolean>
   * to indicate if the transition was successful. You can chain the Promise to
   * do post-processing if you choose.
   * <pre class="prettyprint">
   * <code>
   * router.go({path: 'dashboard'})
   * .then(function () {
   *   this.navigated = true;
   * })
   * // URL "/dashboard"
   * </code>
   * </pre>
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * <h5>Navigate passing dynamic state parameters</h5>
   * Paths are any string within the array to go(), and parameters are any objects
   * in the array. Parameters are always associated with the <i>previous</i> path
   * segment (in this case, "dashboard"), and must have scalar values.
   * <br/>
   * These parameters
   * are made available via the {@link CoreRouterState#params} object.
   * <pre class="prettyprint">
   * <code>
   * router.go({path: 'dashboard', params: {name: 'Dashboard'}})
   * // URL "/dashboard;name=Dashboard"
   * </code>
   * </pre>
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * <h5>Navigate to a nested path</h5>
   * Nested paths are simply another string in the array passed to go(). When an
   * entry in the array is a complex object, it's associated with the previous
   * path entry.
   * <br/>
   * In this example, formatted for clarity, "employee" is the path which will
   * receive the parameters object containing "id" value.
   * <pre class="prettyprint">
   * <code>
   * router.go(
   *   {path: 'employee', params: {id: 456}},
   *   {path: 'contacts'}
   * ])
   * // URL "/employee;id=456/contacts"
   * </code>
   * </pre>
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * <h5>Catching navigation errors</h5>
   * Errors encountered during navigation are returned as Promise rejections, and
   * can be caught with the catch() method.
   * <br/>
   * The types of errors that can occur are:
   * <ul>
   *   <li>No matching state
   *   <li>State change veto'd
   *   <li>Downstream state change listener errors
   * </ul>
   * <pre class="prettyprint">
   * <code>
   * router.go({path: 'home'})
   * .catch(function (error) {
   *   console.error('Routing problem "' + error + '"');
   * });
   * </code>
   * </pre>
   * </p>
   *
   * @param {...CoreRouter.Route} route The route(s) to navigate. Pass multiple routes
   * as separate arguments.
   * @return {Promise.<CoreRouter.CoreRouterState>} A Promise which will resolve
   * with the state to which the router transitioned, if successful. If the transition
   * fails, the Promise will be rejected.

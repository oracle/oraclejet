These are the properties for which\n * we need to maintain an internal state and also trigger certain callbacks whenever we\n * update the internal state.\n *\n * Examples:\n * 1. The `value` property in an uncontrolled InputText\n *\n * Here, we will have `value` property and a corresponding `onValueChanged` callback. When\n * one interacts with the component and updates the value on the UI, we need to update the\n * `value` prop accordingly. Being uncontrolled, we do not have to rely on the parent to push\n * back the value, so we maintain an internal state for it and update the internal state.\n * Even though we are maintaining an internal state, we still need to invoke the callback\n * so we do that when the new value is different from the current value.\n *\n * We use useUncontrolledState hook for getting this behavior like follows:\n * ```\n * const [uncontrolledValue, setUncontrolledValue] = useUncontrolledState(value, onValueChanged);\n * ```\n *\n * Whenever you want to change this value, you would simply do:\n * ```\n * // set the new value\n * setUncontrolledValue(newValue);\n * ```\n * This call automatically calls the `onValueChanged` callback for you when the new value is different.\n * Essentially, you might want to consider using this method if your property supports writeback. This\n * way, whenever we update the internal state, the onPropertyChanged will be invoked automatically with\n * the new value which would in turn writes back the new value on the prop.\n *\n * @param initialState The initial value for the internal state. Calling this hook again with a different\n *                     value for this argument will not update the internal state.\n * @param onStateChange The callback function that needs to be called whenever the state value is updated.\n * @returns A stateful value and a setter function to update it. Here the setter function identity\n *          is stable and won't change on re-renders (similar to useState's setter function)\n */\nexport function useUncontrolledState<V>(\n  initialState?: V,\n  onStateChange?: (value: V, ...args: any[]) => void\n): [V | undefined, (value: V, ...args: any[]) => void] {\n  // Internal state for storing the value\n  const [stateValue, setStateValue] = useState(initialState);\n  // Internal ref to store value.

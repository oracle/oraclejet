The listener can cancel the launch via event.preventDefault(), \nor it can customize the menu contents by editing the menu DOM directly, and then calling refresh() on the Menu.\n\nTo help determine whether it's appropriate to cancel the launch or customize the menu, the ojBeforeOpen listener can use component API's to determine which \ntable cell, chart item, etc., is the target of the context menu. See the JSDoc and demos of the individual components for details. \n\nKeep in mind that any such logic must work whether the context menu was launched via right-click, Shift-F10, Press & Hold, or component-specific touch gesture."

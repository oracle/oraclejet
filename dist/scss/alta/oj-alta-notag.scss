* This is the "no tag selectors" version of the theme file.
* In the regular version of the JET CSS file we directly style certain tags like 
* <p> <a> <h1>, etc. However for developers trying to mix JET with other 
* technologies styling these tags directly could cause issues on other parts of the page. 
* We therefore set $allowTagSelectors: false; in this version of the file.

* See the "compatibility" section of the theming documentation for more information
